# Game Of Life
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), is a cellular automaton developed by John Conway in 1970.  The game, played on a square lattice, has 4 basic rules:

> * Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
> * Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
> * Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
> * Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

# Game Of Life Combat Simulation
First I implemented the Game Of Life complete with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to get a basis for the underlaying data structures.
